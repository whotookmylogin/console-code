**TL;DR:** ConsoleCapture has solid foundations but needs security hardening, performance optimization, and clearer value differentiation from existing dev tools. Updated PRD addresses privacy concerns, adds advanced filtering, and includes integration roadmap.

## Critical Analysis & Improvements

### **Strengths of Current Design**
- Addresses real developer pain point of context switching
- Browser extension approach ensures wide accessibility
- Clipboard integration is simple and universally compatible

### **Major Holes Identified**

**Security & Privacy Vulnerabilities:**
- Console logs often contain sensitive data (API keys, tokens, PII)
- No data sanitization or filtering mechanisms
- Clipboard persistence creates potential data leakage
- Missing consent mechanisms for sensitive data capture

**Technical Limitations:**
- Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions may block console access
- Limited to browser-based development (excludes Node.js, mobile apps)
- No handling of minified/obfuscated stack traces
- Performance impact unclear for high-frequency logging applications

**Market Differentiation Issues:**
- Chrome DevTools already exports console logs
- Existing tools like LogRocket, Sentry provide superior context
- Browser's built-in copy functionality covers basic use cases

**User Experience Gaps:**
- No collaboration features for team debugging
- Missing integration with popular IDEs beyond clipboard
- No filtering for noise reduction in high-volume logging
- Lack of visual indicators for capture status

## **Updated Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

### **1. Product Overview**

**Product Name:** ConsoleCapture Pro  
**Product Type:** Intelligent Browser Extension for Developer Productivity  
**Target Audience:** Frontend developers, QA engineers, DevOps teams, and technical support  
**Objective:** Securely capture, filter, and intelligently format console logs with contextual metadata for seamless integration into development workflows while maintaining privacy and security standards.

### **2. Problem Statement**

Modern web applications generate massive amounts of console output, making it difficult to identify relevant debugging information quickly. Developers waste significant time manually copying logs, lose context when switching between browser and IDE, and struggle with sensitive data exposure in shared debugging sessions. Current solutions either lack context (manual copy-paste) or are overkill for simple debugging scenarios (full APM solutions).

### **3. Enhanced Objectives and Goals**

- **Intelligent Capture:** AI-powered filtering to identify relevant errors and warnings
- **Secure Handling:** Automatic PII detection and sanitization
- **Rich Context:** Capture network requests, localStorage state, and DOM snapshots
- **Team Collaboration:** Shareable debug packages with privacy controls
- **IDE Integration:** Direct plugins for VS Code, JetBrains, and popular editors
- **Performance Monitoring:** Zero-impact capture with configurable throttling

### **4. Key Features & Functional Requirements**

#### **4.1. Advanced Log Capture & Analysis**
```javascript
// Smart filtering examples
- Error correlation across multiple console sources
- Stack trace enhancement and source map resolution
- Performance metric correlation (CLS, FCP, etc.)
- Network request correlation with console errors
```

#### **4.2. Security & Privacy Controls**
- **Data Sanitization Engine:** Regex-based PII detection and masking
- **Sensitivity Scoring:** Machine learning classification of log sensitivity
- **Consent Management:** User prompts for capturing potentially sensitive data
- **Local-Only Mode:** Option to disable all external communications

#### **4.3. Enhanced Contextual Information**
```yaml
Context Package:
  - Console logs with timestamps and log levels
  - Current URL, referrer, and navigation history
  - Browser/device fingerprint (non-tracking)
  - Network requests (filtered by relevance)
  - LocalStorage/SessionStorage snapshots
  - Current viewport and scroll position
  - Performance metrics and resource timing
  - User actions leading to error (click trail)
```

#### **4.4. Multi-Format Export & Integration**
- **JSON Schema:** Structured data for programmatic processing
- **Markdown:** Human-readable format for documentation
- **GitHub Issue Template:** Pre-formatted for issue creation
- **Slack/Teams Integration:** Rich message formatting
- **IDE Plugins:** Direct insertion into VS Code, WebStorm

#### **4.5. Collaboration & Sharing**
- **Debug Packages:** Encrypted, shareable bundles with expiration
- **Team Workspaces:** Shared capture settings and filters
- **Annotation System:** Add notes and tags to captured sessions
- **Issue Tracking Integration:** Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues connectivity

### **5. Advanced Non-Functional Requirements**

#### **5.1. Performance Benchmarks**
- <2ms capture latency for individual log entries
- <50MB memory footprint for 1000+ captured entries
- <1% CPU utilization during active monitoring
- Graceful degradation under high-frequency logging

#### **5.2. Security Standards**
- Zero-knowledge architecture for sensitive data
- GDPR/CCPA compliance for data handling
- Content Security Policy compatibility
- Sandboxed execution environment for log processing

### **6. Technical Architecture Updates**

#### **6.1. Modular Extension Design**
