## How It Works

```

The browser extension captures console logs and streams them via WebSocket to VSCode, where they appear in a dedicated tree view with full debugging context.

- `Console Capture: Stop Server` - Stop the WebSocket server  
- `Console Capture: Clear Logs` - Clear all captured console logs
- `Console Capture: Export Logs` - Export logs to JSON file

## Configuration

```json
{
  "consoleCapture.port": 8765,           // WebSocket server port
  "consoleCapture.autoStart": true,      // Auto-start server when VSCode opens  
  "consoleCapture.maxLogs": 1000         // Maximum logs to keep in memory
}
```
